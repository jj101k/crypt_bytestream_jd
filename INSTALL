To install, it's pretty much just:

ruby extconf.rb
make all install

On the off chance that the binary module can't be compiled, there's an alternate (pure-ruby) core, that
you can install by doing:

ruby install-pr.rb

However, you should note that the binary module is faster, if not massively so.
